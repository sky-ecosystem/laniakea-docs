## Token Mechanics

### USDS
- 1:1 peg to USD
- Minted against collateral or via PSM
- Convertible 1:1 with DAI
- Available on multiple chains via SkyLink

### sUSDS
- ERC-4626 vault token
- Exchange rate increases at Sky Savings Rate
- No lock-up; freely redeemable
- Earns yield on all supported chains

### SKY
- Governance voting power
- Staking rewards (SSTR)
- Collateral for SKY-backed borrowing
- Deflationary via Smart Burn Engine
- 24,000 SKY = 1 MKR (conversion rate)

### stUSDS
- Segregated from main protocol risk
- Higher yield than sUSDS (compensates for haircut risk)
- Dynamic debt ceiling = total stUSDS deposits
- Absorbs losses from SKY liquidation failures

### srUSDS
- LCTS-based subscribe/redeem
- Exchange rate set each settlement
- Increases from yield, decreases from haircuts
- Global senior risk capital for USDS

### NFAT
