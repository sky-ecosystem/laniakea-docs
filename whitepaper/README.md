## Strategy

This README is the canonical whitepaper strategy and checklist.

Deprecated strategy docs exist for historical context, but are not part of the distributed `active/` document set.

**Core Messaging:**
- World's largest decentralized stablecoin protocol (9B+ USDS)
- $300B opportunity: idle stablecoins wanting yield
- 75%+ of profits to SKY holders
- Basel III-inspired risk framework

**Main Document Structure:**
1. The Hook — scale, opportunity, profit share
2. Brief History — MakerDAO to Sky
3. How Sky Makes Money — stablecoin business model
4. Token System — USDS, sUSDS, SKY
5. Agent Framework — capital deployment hierarchy
6. Risk Management — capital requirements
7. Growth Vectors — multi-chain, Generators
8. Governance — brief overview

**Key Principles:**
- Lead with value, not architecture
- Familiar before novel
- Progressive disclosure
- Institutional language

## Review Checklist

- "Sky Ecosystem" vs "Sky Protocol" used consistently
- Decentralization claims are precise (no implied guarantees)
- Governance-dependent items qualified (e.g., "under current parameters")
- No investment advice or profit guarantees
- No forward-looking yield numbers (historical only, dated)
- Forward-looking statements labeled as expectations/plans
